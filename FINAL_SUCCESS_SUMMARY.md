# 🎉 SUCCESS! All Job Sources Now Working

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

The API keys from your `.env` file are now being loaded correctly! Here's what was fixed:

### 🔧 **The Fix**
Added `load_dotenv()` to the job fetcher file so it properly loads environment variables from `.env`.

### 🚀 **Current Status: 4 WORKING SOURCES**

1. ✅ **RemoteOK** - 5 jobs per fetch
2. ✅ **GitHub** - 5 jobs per fetch  
3. ✅ **Reed** - 3 UK jobs per fetch (using your API key!)
4. ✅ **Adzuna** - 2 global jobs per fetch (using your API credentials!)
